```

## Data
Data is a public Databricks dataset stored in DBFS.
```{r}
if (!("all_flights" %in% odbc::dbListTables(sc))) {
  spark_read_csv(sc, 
                 name = "all_flights", 
                 path = "/databricks-datasets/asa/airlines") %>% 
    mutate(
      DepTime = as.integer(DepTime),
      ArrTime = as.integer(ArrTime),
      TailNum = as.integer(TailNum),
      ActualElapsedTime = as.integer(ActualElapsedTime),
      CRSElapsedTime = as.integer(CRSElapsedTime),
      AirTime = as.integer(AirTime),
      ArrDelay = as.integer(ArrDelay),
      DepDelay = as.integer(DepDelay),
      Distance = as.integer(Distance),
      TaxiIn = as.integer(TaxiIn),
      TaxiOut = as.integer(TaxiOut),
      CarrierDelay = as.integer(CarrierDelay),
      WeatherDelay = as.integer(WeatherDelay),
      NASDelay = as.integer(NASDelay),
      SecurityDelay = as.integer(SecurityDelay),
      LateAircraftDelay = as.integer(LateAircraftDelay)
    ) %>% 
   spark_write_table(name = "all_flights", mode = "overwrite", options = list(path = "dbfs:/flights")) 
}
```

Refer to the persistent table
```{r}
all_flights <- tbl(sc, "all_flights")
```

## Exploration
How many rows of data are included in `all_flights`
```{r}
(n_flights <- tally(all_flights) %>% 
   collect())
```

What columns are included in `all_flights`
```{r}
head(all_flights)
```

How many records exist for each year?
```{r}
(year_counts <- count(all_flights, year) %>% 
  arrange(year))
```

```{r}
year_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Flight Records per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Flights")
```

How many airlines are represented in the data?
```{r}
all_flights %>% 
  left_join(tbl(sc, "airlines"), by = c("UniqueCarrier" = "carrier")) %>% 
  count(UniqueCarrier, name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Visualization is a powerful tool for exploring data. However, in this case we have `r n_flights` records, so pulling all of the data into R for visualization isn't ideal. Instead, we can use existing tools to compute summarizations of the data using Spark and then use ggplot2 to visualize those summarizations.

Distribution of arrival delays by airline
```{r}
all_flights %>% 
  
```


```{r}
all_flights %>% 
  dbplot:::dbplot_boxplot(UniqueCarrier, ArrDelay)
```

Unique flights defined by origin and destination
```{r}
all_flights %>% 
  count(Origin, Dest) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

What's the relationship between the different delay fields?
```{r}
all_flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(DepDelay)) %>% 
  select(contains("Delay")) %>% 
  head()
```



## Disconnect
```{r}
spark_disconnect(sc)
```
